    - subject: Use systemd in a container instead of mocks
      hash: 8f551fedfa35c8e85f181d39b299bafe39d1209d
      body: |
        This will allow to test more complex behaviors against
        an actual systemd implementation.

        This only mocks the login manager API to allow manipulating
        the system state.

    - subject: Fix initial setup of units from env var
      hash: 923e996a21fe22f491d68c7f7d8bf6686a51fbc5
      body: |
        Initial units were previously setup in the start.sh script but
        this would create a race where units could not be created fast enough
        before the tests in the sut container ran. This moves the unit
        creation to main.rs so the units can be made available as soon as the
        server is setup.
